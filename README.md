# 🚀 OpenBuild

**OpenBuild** is a "Build in Public" platform where developers can document their journey, share progress logs, and showcase their projects to a community of builders.



## 🌟 Vision
Most platforms show the finished product. OpenBuild shows the **process**. It's a space to track milestones, tech stacks, and daily updates, helping developers build accountability and a public portfolio simultaneously.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python / Flask
- **Database:** SQLAlchemy (SQLite for development)
- **Authentication:** Flask-Login & Bcrypt
- **Forms:** Flask-WTF
- **Frontend:** Jinja2, Custom CSS3 (Grid & Flexbox)

## 📊 Project Status: MVP Development (Phase 2)
I am currently building out the core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for projects.

### ✅ Completed
- [x] **User Auth:** Secure registration, login, and session management.
- [x] **Database Schema:** One-to-Many relationship (User -> Projects).
- [x] **Project Management:** Create project form and private dashboard list view.
- [x] **UI/UX Polish:** Responsive card-based grid layout and brand-consistent styling.

### 🚧 In Progress
- [ ] **Project Detail View:** Dedicated pages for deep-dives into specific projects.
- [ ] **Timeline System:** The "Update" engine to post daily build logs.
- [ ] **Public Feed:** A global discovery page for all active builds.
