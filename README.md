# 🚀 OpenBuild

**OpenBuild** is a specialized "Build in Public" platform designed for developers to document their technical journeys, track milestones, and showcase the messy, real-world process of creation.

## 🌟 Vision
Traditional portfolios show the finished product; OpenBuild shows the **evolution**. By tracking daily logs and tech stacks, developers build accountability, a public paper trail of their expertise, and a community of fellow builders.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python / Flask
- **Database:** SQLAlchemy (SQLite/PostgreSQL ready)
- **Authentication:** Flask-Login & Bcrypt
- **Markdown Engine:** Integrated Markdown parser for technical build logs
- **Frontend:** Jinja2 Templates, Modern CSS3 (Grid & Flexbox Architecture)

## 📊 Project Status: MVP Development (Phase 3/4)
The core infrastructure for private project management and chronological logging is now fully operational.

### ✅ Completed
- **User Authentication:** Secure registration, login, and protected route management.
- **Project Management:** Full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for developer projects.
- **Timeline Engine:** A specialized "Journey Log" system allowing users to post updates with images and formatted text.
- **Rich Text Support:** Full Markdown integration in build logs for code snippets and technical documentation.
- **Advanced UI/UX:** A modern, responsive "Timeline" interface with vertical milestone tracking and optimized grid layouts.

### 🚧 Current Focus: Phase 4 (Home Feed)
- **Public Feed:** Developing a global discovery route to display project updates from the entire community.
- **Pagination & Sorting:** Implementing efficient data loading for high-volume build logs.
- **User Profiles:** Expanding account settings to include developer bios and profile images.

## 🔮 Future Vision: AI Marketing Agent
The platform is being architected to support an **AI Video Agent** that will parse your Markdown build logs to automatically generate 30-second "DevLog" reels and social media content of your progress.
